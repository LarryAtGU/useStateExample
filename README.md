# useStateExample

This repository contains a demo React Native project designed to illustrate the proper usage of the `useState` hook for managing state in functional components. It demonstrates the importance of immutable state updates, especially when dealing with complex data types like arrays.

## Overview

The `useState` hook is a fundamental part of React's Hooks API, enabling functional components to hold and set internal state. However, updating complex state types (e.g., arrays and objects) requires careful handling to ensure the component re-renders correctly. This project showcases common pitfalls and best practices through simple, interactive examples.

## Project Structure

- **App.js**: The main component file demonstrating three key scenarios:
  - Incrementing a numerical state.
  - Incorrectly updating an array state by direct mutation (which leads to no re-render).
  - Correctly updating an array state using immutable update patterns (which ensures re-render).

## Setup and Run

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LarryAtGU/useStateExample.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd useStateExample
npm install
```

3. **Run the Project**

```bash
npm start
```

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **useState Hook**: Introduction to `useState` and its role in adding stateful logic to functional components.

- **Immutable State Updates**: Showcases the necessity of avoiding direct mutation of state variables for arrays and objects. Demonstrates how to perform immutable updates to ensure component re-renders correctly.

- **Common Pitfalls**: Highlights a common mistake when updating arrays in state - using array methods like `push` that mutate the array directly.

- **Best Practices**: Provides examples of best practices for updating state, emphasizing the use of the spread operator and functional updates to manage complex state changes.
